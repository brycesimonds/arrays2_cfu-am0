# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
It makes sense which is good news! I understand that it applies to each of the elements in the Array.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I noticed that! And really enjoyed it actually. I enjoyed googling and trying different combinations of code. Even learned get.chomp! I did have productive struggle while googling. It was figuring out how to phrase my google search to get the answer I wanted. The Unproductive struggle I had today was during an if statement..I typed If instead and it threw the whole code off.


- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Getting more comfortable with iteration as a whole will be helpful. Don't need to adjust my calendar yet.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None as of now. Just going to practice more :)
